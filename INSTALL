Installation of this program has several prerequisites:

*  The X Window system.  X.Org is the tested platform, but it
   should work on others too.

*  Mesa,  OpenGL or any other clone of OpenGL.  Mesa is 
   available from http://www.mesa3d.org 
   You can find further information about OpenGL at http://www.opengl.org
 
*  gtk+-2.0 version 2.6 or later.
   
*  You will also need the GTK Mesa/OpenGL extension 
   library ( http://gtkglext.sourceforge.net ).

*  libguile version 1.6.4 or later.


To install the program, do the following steps.

1)	Run the configure script, by typing the command `./configure'.

2)	Type `make'.

3)	Check that it works `./src/gnubik'.

4)	Check that the documentation files compiled correctly.  Type 
	`info -f ./doc/gnubik.info'  and then `man ./doc/gnubik.6'.

5)	If you like it,  type `make install' .  This last one,
	will probably need to be done as root.
